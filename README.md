# ZX-Spectrum-Logic-Analyser-Interface
Copied and Modified from an original idea (V3.1) by HappyLittleDiodes(Jim)

Increased space between Logic Analyser Connectors so as to allow for Pico on 10mm headers on Logic Analyser PCB's

PCB size increased to allow for the above

Added 3 pin header to allow for manual connection to the unused channels (6,7 and 26)
